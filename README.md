# Cochlea frequency maps
This is a collection of functions and equations to relate the position in the cochlea to its frequency code. I collected them for convenience, as I sometimes need them for histology during my research and for other purposes. The list is "mouse-heavy".
I attempt to link them to primary literature as documentation. 
This is obviously not an exhaustive list and will be gradually updated as more maps came into my radar.
